The presence of parasitaemia after 7 days due to reinfection was considered as PCR-corrected ACPR. Missing blood smear data at Day 15 visit and thereafter were not considered as responder for the visit unless there was a later blood smear test indicating no parasitaemia., Day 15, Day 29|Parasite Clearance Time (PCT), Parasite Clearance Time (PCT) is defined as the time from the first dose until the first total and continued disappearance of asexual parasite forms which remained at least a further 48 hours. In case a patient received rescue medication before (parasite) clearance, the time to event was censored at the first use of rescue medication., Day 29|Fever Clearance Time (FCT), Fever Clearance Time (FCT) is defined as the time from the first dose until the first time the axillary body temperature decreased below and remained below 37.5°C axillary or 38.0°C oral/tympanic/rectal for at least a further 24 hours. In case a patient received rescue medication before (fever) clearance, the time to event was censored at the first use of rescue medication., Day 29|Time to Recrudescence and Reinfection at Study Day 29, Time to recrudescence is calculated from the date of first study medication to the date of first event. Participants without recrudescence/reinfection after Day 7 are censored at the time of treatment failure or at the time of last parasite assessment if no treatment failure occured., Day 29|Maximum Peak Observed Concentration (Cmax), Maximum Peak Observed Concentration (Cmax), Day 1, Day 3|Tmax, Tmax, Day 1, Day 3|AUC0-24, AUC0-24, Day 1, Day 3|Half-life (T^1/2), Half-life (T\^1/2), Upto day 15 post dose",,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Supported by Wellcome Trust via Grant # Grant Number 207813/Z/17/Z,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,188,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CKAE609A2202|207813/Z/17/Z,2017-11-16,2019-11-23,2019-11-23,2017-11-07,2020-09-03,2021-10-11,"Novartis Investigative Site, Lambarene, Gabon|Novartis Investigative Site, Kintampo, Ghana|Novartis Investigative Site, Navrango, Ghana|Novartis Investigative Site, Bamako, Mali|Novartis Investigative Site, Sotuba, Mali|Novartis Investigative Site, Kigali, Rwanda|Novartis Investigative Site, Bushenyi, Uganda|Novartis Investigative Site, Kampala, Uganda|Novartis Investigative Site, Tororo, Uganda","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/47/NCT03334747/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/47/NCT03334747/SAP_001.pdf"

NCT01955382,Evaluation of Oral Activated Charcoal on Antimalarial Drug's Ability to Kill Parasites in Malian Children With Malaria,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01955382,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Malaria is caused by small parasites carried by some mosquitoes. People can get malaria if an infected mosquito bites them. Malaria destroys red blood cells. Most malaria is mild, but some children develop severe malaria, which kills about 660,000 people annually. About 9 in 10 who die of malaria are Sub-Saharan African children, most under 5 years old. Scientists can save many lives if they find out how to prevent or relieve severe malaria.

Objective:

- To know if a common medicine called activated charcoal can reduce severe malaria symptoms.

Eligibility:

- Children 2 to 11 years old with mild malaria who live in Kenieroba, Mali.

Design:

* For the first 2 days and nights, participants will stay in the hospital.
* They will have their medical history taken, and a physical exam.
* Blood will be drawn from a thin tube inserted in their hand or forearm. This will be done 3 times overall. A drop of blood will be taken from a finger prick 12 times overall.
* An antimalarial drug will be injected into the tube in the arm 4 times. Each time the drug is given, participants will drink a small cup of either water or activated charcoal.
* For the following 3 days, participants will take an antimalarial pill.
* On day 7, participants will visit the hospital.

NCT02376283,P3AMI Antiplatelet Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02376283,,COMPLETED,"Major heart attacks are caused by a numerous factors, including sudden clot formation in a coronary artery leading to a blockage and heart muscle death. The clots are largely made of sticky clotting blood cells (platelets). A patient having a major heart attack is treated with emergency primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) where a wire and balloon are used to reopen the coronary artery and a stent (a slotted metal tube) is placed to keep the artery open.

Aspirin, and one of two other antiplatelet drugs (prasugrel or ticagrelor) are given prior to PPCI to prevent further clots formation. Both antiplatelet drugs are taken in tablet form and in healthy stable patients these drugs take at least 30 min to 2 hours to exert an adequate effect. Often PPCI procedures are performed well within this timescale. It is possible that having a major heart attack limits the bodies ability to absorb the drugs also.

In this study, patients with major or minor heart attacks will be given either prasugrel or ticagrelor as per licensed indications and guideline recommendations. A 15 ml blood sample will be taken at first balloon inflation to reopen the blocked artery, then after 20 minutes, 60 minutes, and 4 hours after taking the drugs. Each blood sample will be subjected to a variety of tests to determine antiplatelet drug activity.

This study will identify which of the two agents used are working effectively during PPCI, given the very short timescales involved. It will also show if patients with major heart attacks absorb the drugs less well than patients with less severe heart attacks.

NCT02548650,Vorapaxar as an Add-On Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With and Without Diabetes Mellitus,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02548650,OPTIMUS-5,COMPLETED,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, more frequently clopidogrel, represents the standard of care for the long-term secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, rates of ischemic recurrences remain high. Vorapaxar is a protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 inhibitor, which exerts potent inhibition of thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are known to be at increased risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events, which translates into worse outcomes, despite the use of standard of care therapy. This is in part due to the hyperreactive platelet phenotype, which characterizes DM patients, and to inadequate response to oral antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel. Therefore, vorapaxar is an attractive treatment option for DM patients with a prior MI. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of vorapaxar in DM patients and how these may differentiate from non-DM patients has not been explored. Further, the role of vorapaxar as part of a dual antithrombotic treatment regimen combined with clopidogrel (and stopping aspirin) represents another important area of clinical interest.

The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of their depression by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicide ideation, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal. Scores of 20 or higher indicate moderate, severe, or very severe depression, and are usually required for entry into a clinical trial. Assessment time is estimated at 20 minutes (Hamilton, 1960). Higher values represent a worse outcome. The HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17.Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2, with a total score range of 0-50., 4 weeks|Anxiety, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a psychological questionnaire used by clinicians to rate the severity of a patient's anxiety (Hamilton, 1959; McDowell, Newell \& \& McDowell, 2006). The scale consists of 14 items designed to assess the severity of a patient's anxiety. Each of the 14 items contains a number of symptoms, and each group of symptoms is rated on a scale of zero to four, with four being the most severe (with a total score range of 0-56). All of these scores are used to compute an overarching score that indicates a person's anxiety severity (Vaccarino, 2008). A score of 17 or less indicates mild anxiety severity. A score from 18 to 24 indicates mild to moderate anxiety severity. Lastly, a score of 25 to 30 indicates a moderate to severe anxiety severity.

NCT02685488,Investigating Transcranial Ultrasound as a Potential Intervention for Depression,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02685488,,COMPLETED,"Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Because a significant number of people with depression do not respond to medication or therapy, alternative treatment options are greatly needed. Recent research has focused on brain stimulation methods due to their therapeutic utility for treating depression. Yet, current brain stimulation methods have drawbacks, including invasive surgery and limited precision in targeting specific areas. A novel brain stimulation method, transcranial ultrasound (TUS), is noninvasive, has greater spatial precision than most existing methods, and is proven safe for humans. TUS has been found to increase positive mood in chronic pain patients. In a double blind study, TUS increased positive mood in over 140 healthy undergraduates at the University of Arizona.

Despite evidence that TUS can increase positive mood in humans, it has yet to be investigated whether TUS can increase positive mood in humans who are experiencing chronic low mood or depression. The present study will, for the first time, examine whether TUS can improve depressive symptoms. Twenty to thirty participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory Score between 10 and 25) will be randomly assigned to a TUS sham or TUS activation condition. In the TUS activation condition, TUS will be used to stimulate the right fronto-temporal area, which has previously been shown to increase positive mood. Participants in the TUS sham condition will not receive any brain stimulation. Participants will attend five sessions within seven days or ten sessions within fourteen days. At each session, in addition to brain stimulation, self-reported mood and depressive symptoms will be recorded. Furthermore, the investigators will use electroencephalogram (EEG) to record changes in brain electrical signals during TUS stimulation. Based on prior research, the investigators predict that mood will increase and depressive symptoms will decrease with TUS stimulation.",YES,Depression|Anxiety Disorders,DEVICE: Transcranial Ultrasound Power|DEVICE: Transcranial Ultrasound Sham,"Depressive Symptoms Assessed With the Beck Depression Inventory-II, The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is one of the most widely used self-report measures for assessing depression.

It measures rumination, past-focused repetitive thinking that causes and maintains depression. Participants are asked to rate on a scale of 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always) how much they think about various things (e.g. ""think about how alone you feel"" and ""think about all your shortcomings, failings, faults, mistakes""). Scores range from 22 to 88 with higher scores indicating more rumination. The RRS was used in this study to measure symptoms of rumination on the first and fifth day of this study.

Median PFS time was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots., From the first randomization until the end of study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Assessed by the Investigators According to RECIST Criteria, Objective response (OR) included complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\]. OR was to be assessed by the Investigators according to RECIST criteria, and confirmed by repeating tumor imaging at least 4 weeks after the first radiological documentation of response.

CR would reflect the disappearance of all tumor lesions and PR would reflect a defined reduction of tumor burden.

However, OR analysis was not performed, as the study was terminated due to futility., From the first randomization until the end of the study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years)|Clinical Benefit, Clinical benefit was to be assessed in all participants by time to symptom worsening (TTSW), evaluated from the time of randomization to symptom worsening, as well as by improvement in tumor related symptoms.

NCT01953003,Phase III Study of Vinflunine Plus Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Alone in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01953003,,COMPLETED,"Options for the treatment of patients who have progressed after an anthracycline and a taxane are limited. Capecitabine currently has a role in this setting, yet as many as 80% of patients do not respond to this treatment and those who respond eventually develop clinical resistance.

The antitumour activity of vinflunine has been demonstrated in patients with breast cancer after exposure to anthracycline and to taxane.

Vinflunine plus capecitabine has been shown to be a feasible combination for patients previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. Each drug in combination can be administered at efficacious doses.

This population has few therapeutic options with established clinical benefit. The development of a new regimen and potential new standard of care for this group is important.

* Primary objective:

  • to compare in patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated with anthracycline and taxane the efficacy of the combination of vinflunine and capecitabine with capecitabine alone, in terms of progression-free survival.
* Secondary objectives:

  * to evaluate the response rate, the time to response and the duration of response in both arms
  * to compare the disease control rate between arms
  * to evaluate the duration of disease control in both arms
  * to evaluate the overall survival in both arms
  * to evaluate safety

LMB-100 is a man-made protein designed to kill cancer cells. LMB-100 targets a cancer marker called mesothelin. Mesothelin is found on the surface of many different tumors, including pancreatic cancer, but is made by a very small number of normal tissues. Other cancers that make mesothelin include mesothelioma, cholangiocarcinoma, thymic carcinoma, ovarian, lung, gastric, endometrial, cervical, and ampullary cancers. After binding to the mesothelin on tumors, LMB-100 can attack and kill cancer cells. Researchers want to see how well it works when given with and without nab-paclitaxel, a drug which treats pancreatic cancer.

Objectives:

Arm A- To find a safe dose of LMB-100 with a fixed standard dose of nab-paclitaxel in people with advanced pancreatic cancer. To see how well the combination of the two drugs reduce tumor size.

Arm B- To find a safe dose of LMB-100 when it is given as a continuous infusion over several days.

Eligibility:

Arm A- Adults age 18 and older with advanced pancreatic cancer that has worsened after anti-cancer therapy.

Arm B- Adults age 18 and older with advanced pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma or other solid tumor that makes mesothelin that has worsened after anti-cancer therapy

Design:

Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will give blood, urine, and tissue samples. They will have scans and x-rays.

During each 21-day cycle:

* For Arm A

  * Participants will get LMB-100 by an intravenous (IV) catheter on days 1, 3, and 5. This is a tube inserted in a vein, usually in the arm.
  * Participants will get nab-paclitaxel by IV on days 1 and 8.
* For Arm B

  * Participants will get LMB-100 by an IV catheter as a continuous infusion beginning on day 1 and continuing for 2-4 days
  * Some participants will also get nab-paclitaxel by IV on days 1 and 8.

All participants will get this combination for up to 2 cycles or until their disease worsens or they have intolerable side effects.

Participants will have blood and urine tests and scans throughout the study.

Participants will have a safety follow-up visit 3-6 weeks after treatment ends. If their disease remains stable or improves, they will be scanned every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse. Even if their disease gets worse, they or their doctor will be called to talk about their cancer status....",YES,Neoplasms|Pancreatic Neoplasms,DRUG: LMB-100|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DEVICE: Mesothelin Expression|DRUG: LMB-100,"Objective Response (OR) (Partial Responses + Complete Responses) in Phase 2 Subjects of Short Infusion LMB-100+ Nab-paclitaxel, OR is defined as partial responses + complete response in participants in the phase 2 Arm A portion of the study assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1.

Gastrointestinal tumors have a molecule called carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) in the tumors and blood. The agent MVT-5873 was designed to block this molecule. Researchers want to test how safe it is to give this agent to people before and after surgery to remove a tumor. They want to learn the highest dose tolerated. They want to see if getting the agent at surgery helps slow down the disease.

Objective:

To test the safety of giving MVT-5873 at surgery to remove cancer and see if it slows the progression of the disease.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old with certain cancers and certain blood CA19-9 levels

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Blood and heart tests
* Scans
* Review of normal activities
* Review of tumor sample
* Pregnancy test

A few days before surgery, participants will get a dose of the study agent. They will get it through a small plastic tube in a vein over about 2 hours.

Participants will sign a separate consent and have the surgery. A sample of the tumor and normal liver will be removed for research.

For 1-2 weeks after surgery, participants will recover in intensive care then regular care at the hospital. They will be monitored and treated throughout the stay.

After leaving the hospital, participants will get the study agent every week for 1 month. Then they will get it every other week for 2 months.

NCT05817110,Validating Artificial Intelligence Effectiveness Defined Lung Nodule Malignancy Score in Patients With Pulmonary Nodule.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05817110,CREATE,RECRUITING,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithms have demonstrated increased accuracy in predicting the risk of Lung Cancer among patients with an incidental pulmonary nodule (IPN) on chest radiographs. Qure.ai, an AI company specializing in the reading of chest X- Rays (CXRs) by a proprietary algorithm and has developed a new model, qXR, that can report the lung nodule malignancy score (LNMS) based on lung nodule features.

Our study aims to prospectively validate the lung nodule malignancy score against radiologist assessment of CT scans and Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System score (Lung-RADS).(lung RADS score explained below) Thus, lung nodule malignancy score (interpreted by qXR as a high or low category) will be compared with radiologist-based assessment probability of CT scan and Lung-RADS assessment. The results of this prospective observational study will pave the way for improved nodule management, leading to better clinical outcomes in patients with incidental pulmonary nodule (IPNs), especially concerning malignancy assessment.",NO,Lung Malignancy,OTHER: Participant Cohort,"To estimate the positive and negative predictive values of qXR LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score ) in a multi-centre real-world setting., PPV( positive predictive value) of qXR-LNMS using a panel of radiologists assigning high-risk based on CT (done within 180 days from Xray) as the reference standard The PPV here is the number of nodules rated as high risk as assessed by a reference standard (a panel of radiologists) on CT divided by the total number of high-risk nodules as reported by qXR-LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score ) (n = 500) NPV( negative predictive value) of qXR-LNMS using panel of radiologists assigning low-risk based on CT (done within 180days from X-ray) as reference standard.

The NPV here is number of nodules rated as low risk as assessed by a reference standard (a panel of radiologists) on CT divided by total number of low-risk nodules as reported by qXR-LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score ) (n = 200), 6 months from the Last subject In.","Demographic and clinical factors associated with high or low predictive values association of qXR LNMS with the Mayo score model., PPV (positive predictive value) of qXR-LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score) using panel of radiologists assigning Lung-RADS (lung RADS score explained in description )\>4A based on CT as reference standard.
