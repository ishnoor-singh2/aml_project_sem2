NCT02318095,Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel With HIGRT in Resectable Pancreatic Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02318095,,COMPLETED,"This research protocol will evaluate the feasibility of administering neoadjuvant gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with hypofractionated, image guided, intensity modulated radiotherapy (HIGRT) in resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer",YES,Resectable Pancreatic Cancers,DRUG: Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel|RADIATION: Radiation therapy|OTHER: Sugical resection|DRUG: Adjuvant chemotheapy,"Feasibility as Measured by Number of Participants Who Complete the Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel and HIGRT Regimen, The neoadjuvant regimen will be considered feasible if (a) the trial can accrue 25 patients in no more than 3 years and (b) if at least 17 of the 25 patients adhere to the neoadjuvant regimen and c) the acute grade 3+ non-hematologic acute toxicity is less than 50% (exclusing fatigue and alopecia)., approximately 6 months","Number of Participants Experiencing Grade >/=2 Acute Toxicity, CTCAE version 4 will be used for all toxicity assessments. The acute toxicity rate, defined as any non-hematologic grade 2+ toxicity occurring during HIGRT treatment through 60 days post-treatment, will be estimated with its exact 80% confidence interval. Likewise, we will determine the rate of grade 2+ hematologic toxicity occurring during treatment through 60 days post treatment and the proportion of patients requiring treatment breaks longer than 5 days., 60 days post surgery|Number of Participants Who Underwent Surgical Resection, Patients who undergo surgical resection will be documented, 14-30 days post surgery|Number of Participants Who Received an R0 Resection, Pathologic review will determine if an R0 resection has been performed. R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed., 14-30 days post surgery",,Duke University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,40,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Pro00058865,2015-02-17,2018-11-07,2022-11-14,2014-12-17,2021-06-10,2023-10-26,"Duke Cancer Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/95/NCT02318095/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
