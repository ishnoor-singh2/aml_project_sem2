NCT02158039,Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Ethanol Injection of Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02158039,,COMPLETED,"Cystic tumors of the pancreas are fluid-filled growths. They are often treated by surgical removal. A safe and effective non-surgical treatment is desirable. Ethanol (alcohol) injection may treat cysts by killing the lining cells of the cyst, and is an accepted treatment for cysts of other organs. In this study, participants with pancreatic cysts underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided ethanol injection of pancreatic cysts. This was a pilot study to assess safety and efficacy.

The hypotheses of this study were 1) complications of EUS guided ethanol injection requiring hospitalization will occur in \<10% of subjects, and 2) EUS guided ethanol injection, with retreatment as necessary, will ablate at least 50% of pancreatic cysts.",YES,"Neoplasms, Cystic, Mucinous, and Serous",DRUG: Ethanol|DRUG: Lidocaine,"Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Adverse events include pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, any other occurrence resulting in hospitalization, medical treatment, surgery, death, or disability, 1 year after final treatment|Number of Subjects With Complete or Partial Ablation of the Treated Cyst, Complete or partial ablation of cysts will be defined by the presence of a persistent cystic structure, and its volume and maximum diameter, as determined by cross-sectional imaging studies (CT, MR), 1 year after final treatment",,,Mayo Clinic,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,33,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,498-04,2004-06,2015-09,2015-09,2014-06-06,2015-12-22,2018-02-05,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States",
