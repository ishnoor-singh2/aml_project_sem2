NCT03801915,"Perioperative MVT-5873, a Fully Human Monoclonal Antibody Against a CA 19-9 Epitope, for Operable CA 19-9 Producing Pancreatic Cancers, Cholangiocarcinomas, and Metastatic Colorectal Cancers",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03801915,,COMPLETED,"Background:

Gastrointestinal tumors have a molecule called carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) in the tumors and blood. The agent MVT-5873 was designed to block this molecule. Researchers want to test how safe it is to give this agent to people before and after surgery to remove a tumor. They want to learn the highest dose tolerated. They want to see if getting the agent at surgery helps slow down the disease.

Objective:

To test the safety of giving MVT-5873 at surgery to remove cancer and see if it slows the progression of the disease.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old with certain cancers and certain blood CA19-9 levels

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Blood and heart tests
* Scans
* Review of normal activities
* Review of tumor sample
* Pregnancy test

A few days before surgery, participants will get a dose of the study agent. They will get it through a small plastic tube in a vein over about 2 hours.

Participants will sign a separate consent and have the surgery. A sample of the tumor and normal liver will be removed for research.

For 1-2 weeks after surgery, participants will recover in intensive care then regular care at the hospital. They will be monitored and treated throughout the stay.

After leaving the hospital, participants will get the study agent every week for 1 month. Then they will get it every other week for 2 months. They will repeat screening tests at study visits and at a follow-up visit. That will be about 5 weeks after the last dose.",YES,Colon Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Cholangiocarcinoma|Metastatic Colon Carcinoma|Liver Metastasis,DRUG: MVT-5873|PROCEDURE: pancreatectomy or hepatectomy,"Number of Participants With Disease Recurrence At 1 Year, Disease recurrence is defined as new disease measurable on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that was not present on the baseline CT/MRI., 1 year|Number of Grade 3-5 Adverse Events Related and/or Not Related to Drug, Adverse events were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). Grade 3 is severe. Grade 4 is life-threatening. Grade 5 is death related to adverse events., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 29 months and 11 days, and 22 months and 21 days for cohort 1 and cohort 2 respectively.","Define Disease Free Survival (DFS) for Participants Treated With Preoperative MVT-5873, Disease free survival is defined as resection day of surgery Day 0 (D0) until the time of documented clinical recurrence (radiographically or pathologically). In the absence of a knowable time of recurrence, time of death will be used as a surrogate. Clinical recurrence is cancer that has recurred during which the cancer could not be detected. This is judged on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as compared to the scan obtained after surgery and completion of the study drug., An average of 15.17 months","Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 29 months and 11 days, and 22 months and 21 days for cohort 1 and cohort 2 respectively.",National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,10,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,190039|19-C-0039,2019-11-13,2022-05-27,2022-05-27,2019-01-14,2023-02-27,2023-03-21,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/15/NCT03801915/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/15/NCT03801915/ICF_001.pdf"
