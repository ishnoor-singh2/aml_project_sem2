NCT02145429,Preventing Depression in Late Life: A Model for Low and Middle Income Countries,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02145429,,COMPLETED,"This study is being conducted in GOA India. The study addresses specific issues of depression prevention in older adults living in low- and middle income countries (LMICs), by developing risk-reduction strategies through the use of lay health counselors. We will be training Lay Health Counselors (LHC's) to deliver simple behaviorally oriented interventions, designed to enhance the ability to relax, to improve active coping via better problem solving, and to increase protective factors such as good quality sleep. Lay Health Counselors are inhabitants of Goa.

The aim of phase 1 is to create a depression and anxiety prevention intervention for use by lay health counselors. We will test the feasibility and acceptability of Problem Solving Therapy for Primary Care (PST-PC) and Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI). The products of phase 1 will be a prevention and counseling manual to standardize the implementation of the interventions for further testing in a randomized prevention trial (Specific Aim 2) and the adaptation of PST-PC and BBTI for the Indian population.

NCT02732561,The Efficacy of Cranial Electrostimulating Therapy for Depression and Anxiety Among Homeless Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02732561,,COMPLETED,This is a trial of the use of cranial electrostimulating therapy for depression and anxiety among homeless adults.,YES,Depression|Anxiety,DEVICE: Alpha Stim device|DEVICE: Sham device,"Depressive Symptoms, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression and as a guide to evaluate recovery (Hedlund, 1979). The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of their depression by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicide ideation, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal. Scores of 20 or higher indicate moderate, severe, or very severe depression, and are usually required for entry into a clinical trial. Assessment time is estimated at 20 minutes (Hamilton, 1960). Higher values represent a worse outcome. The HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17.Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2, with a total score range of 0-50., 4 weeks|Anxiety, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a psychological questionnaire used by clinicians to rate the severity of a patient's anxiety (Hamilton, 1959; McDowell, Newell \& \& McDowell, 2006). The scale consists of 14 items designed to assess the severity of a patient's anxiety. Each of the 14 items contains a number of symptoms, and each group of symptoms is rated on a scale of zero to four, with four being the most severe (with a total score range of 0-56). All of these scores are used to compute an overarching score that indicates a person's anxiety severity (Vaccarino, 2008). A score of 17 or less indicates mild anxiety severity. A score from 18 to 24 indicates mild to moderate anxiety severity. Lastly, a score of 25 to 30 indicates a moderate to severe anxiety severity. Higher values represent a worse outcome., 4 weeks",,,Wake Forest University Health Sciences,,ALL,ADULT,NA,10,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IRB00036461,2016-03,2016-06,2016-06,2016-04-08,2017-01-24,2018-10-16,"Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27117, United States",
NCT02685488,Investigating Transcranial Ultrasound as a Potential Intervention for Depression,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02685488,,COMPLETED,"Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Because a significant number of people with depression do not respond to medication or therapy, alternative treatment options are greatly needed. Recent research has focused on brain stimulation methods due to their therapeutic utility for treating depression. Yet, current brain stimulation methods have drawbacks, including invasive surgery and limited precision in targeting specific areas. A novel brain stimulation method, transcranial ultrasound (TUS), is noninvasive, has greater spatial precision than most existing methods, and is proven safe for humans. TUS has been found to increase positive mood in chronic pain patients. In a double blind study, TUS increased positive mood in over 140 healthy undergraduates at the University of Arizona.

Despite evidence that TUS can increase positive mood in humans, it has yet to be investigated whether TUS can increase positive mood in humans who are experiencing chronic low mood or depression. The present study will, for the first time, examine whether TUS can improve depressive symptoms. Twenty to thirty participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory Score between 10 and 25) will be randomly assigned to a TUS sham or TUS activation condition. In the TUS activation condition, TUS will be used to stimulate the right fronto-temporal area, which has previously been shown to increase positive mood. Participants in the TUS sham condition will not receive any brain stimulation. Participants will attend five sessions within seven days or ten sessions within fourteen days. At each session, in addition to brain stimulation, self-reported mood and depressive symptoms will be recorded. Furthermore, the investigators will use electroencephalogram (EEG) to record changes in brain electrical signals during TUS stimulation. Based on prior research, the investigators predict that mood will increase and depressive symptoms will decrease with TUS stimulation.",YES,Depression|Anxiety Disorders,DEVICE: Transcranial Ultrasound Power|DEVICE: Transcranial Ultrasound Sham,"Depressive Symptoms Assessed With the Beck Depression Inventory-II, The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is one of the most widely used self-report measures for assessing depression. It includes 21 self-report items. Scores range from 0 to 63, and higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms. In this study, the BDI-II was used to monitor depressive symptoms each day. The outcome is the change in BDI-II score as measured by BDI-II on Day 5 minus BDI-II on Day 1., Once on day 1 & day 5","Rumination Symptoms Assessed With the Ruminative Responses Scale, The Ruminative Responses scale (RRS) consists of 22 statements. It measures rumination, past-focused repetitive thinking that causes and maintains depression. Participants are asked to rate on a scale of 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always) how much they think about various things (e.g. ""think about how alone you feel"" and ""think about all your shortcomings, failings, faults, mistakes""). Scores range from 22 to 88 with higher scores indicating more rumination. The RRS was used in this study to measure symptoms of rumination on the first and fifth day of this study. The outcome is the difference from Day 5 to Day 1., Once on day 1 & 5|Worry Symptoms Assessed With the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, The PSWQ assesses trait worry, a key component of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Participants rate themselves on a scale of 1 (""not at all typical of me"") to 5 (""very typical of me"") for sixteen different statements. Scores range from 16-80, and higher scores reflect higher levels of worry. This scale has been widely used to assess worry and will allow for assessment of worry in the present study (Brown et al., 1992). The PSWQ was used to monitor symptoms of worry on first and fifth day of this study. The outcome measure is difference from Day 5 to Day 1., Once on day 1 & day 5|Anxiety Symptoms Assessed With the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale, The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) assesses severity of anxiety symptoms across anxiety disorders and with subsyndromal symptoms. Participants rate five items on a scale from 0 (indicating no anxiety or impairment) to 4 (indicating severe or extreme anxiety or impairment). Scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety and impairment from anxiety (Norman et al., 2006).
