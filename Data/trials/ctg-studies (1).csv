NCT03334747,Safety of KAE609 in Adults With Uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03334747,,COMPLETED,KAE609 will be evaluated primarily for hepatic safety of single and multiple doses in sequential cohorts with increasing doses.This study aims to determine the maximum safe dose of the investigational drug KAE609 in malaria patients.,YES,Malaria,DRUG: KAE609|DRUG: Coartem,"Number of Participants With at Least 2 CTCAE Grades Increase From Baseline in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), The occurrence of at least 2 CTCAE grades increase from baseline in ALT or AST during the 4 weeks study period was evaluated to characterize hepatic safety aspects of single and multiple ascending doses of KAE609 in adult malaria subjects for treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by plasmodium falciparum. If 2 patients in a 10 patient cohort (Cohorts 1 and 2) or 3 patients in a 20 patient cohort (Cohorts 3, 4 and 5) had at least 2 CTCAE grades increase from Baseline in ALT or AST, recruitment was suspended and a review of liver safety (and any other relevant data) by safety review committee was initiated. Any further progression of the study was based on the decision by the safety review committee., Day 29","Percentage of Participants With Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-Corrected and Uncorrected Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR) at Day 15 and Day 29, PCR-corrected and PCR-uncorrected were evaluated at Days 15 and 29 (i.e., 14 and 28 days post-dose). The presence of parasitaemia after 7 days due to reinfection was considered as PCR-corrected ACPR. Missing blood smear data at Day 15 visit and thereafter were not considered as responder for the visit unless there was a later blood smear test indicating no parasitaemia., Day 15, Day 29|Parasite Clearance Time (PCT), Parasite Clearance Time (PCT) is defined as the time from the first dose until the first total and continued disappearance of asexual parasite forms which remained at least a further 48 hours. In case a patient received rescue medication before (parasite) clearance, the time to event was censored at the first use of rescue medication., Day 29|Fever Clearance Time (FCT), Fever Clearance Time (FCT) is defined as the time from the first dose until the first time the axillary body temperature decreased below and remained below 37.5°C axillary or 38.0°C oral/tympanic/rectal for at least a further 24 hours. In case a patient received rescue medication before (fever) clearance, the time to event was censored at the first use of rescue medication., Day 29|Time to Recrudescence and Reinfection at Study Day 29, Time to recrudescence is calculated from the date of first study medication to the date of first event. Participants without recrudescence/reinfection after Day 7 are censored at the time of treatment failure or at the time of last parasite assessment if no treatment failure occured., Day 29|Maximum Peak Observed Concentration (Cmax), Maximum Peak Observed Concentration (Cmax), Day 1, Day 3|Tmax, Tmax, Day 1, Day 3|AUC0-24, AUC0-24, Day 1, Day 3|Half-life (T^1/2), Half-life (T\^1/2), Upto day 15 post dose",,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Supported by Wellcome Trust via Grant # Grant Number 207813/Z/17/Z,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,188,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,CKAE609A2202|207813/Z/17/Z,2017-11-16,2019-11-23,2019-11-23,2017-11-07,2020-09-03,2021-10-11,"Novartis Investigative Site, Lambarene, Gabon|Novartis Investigative Site, Kintampo, Ghana|Novartis Investigative Site, Navrango, Ghana|Novartis Investigative Site, Bamako, Mali|Novartis Investigative Site, Sotuba, Mali|Novartis Investigative Site, Kigali, Rwanda|Novartis Investigative Site, Bushenyi, Uganda|Novartis Investigative Site, Kampala, Uganda|Novartis Investigative Site, Tororo, Uganda","Study Protocol, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/47/NCT03334747/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/47/NCT03334747/SAP_001.pdf"

NCT01955382,Evaluation of Oral Activated Charcoal on Antimalarial Drug's Ability to Kill Parasites in Malian Children With Malaria,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01955382,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Malaria is caused by small parasites carried by some mosquitoes. People can get malaria if an infected mosquito bites them. Malaria destroys red blood cells. Most malaria is mild, but some children develop severe malaria, which kills about 660,000 people annually. About 9 in 10 who die of malaria are Sub-Saharan African children, most under 5 years old. Scientists can save many lives if they find out how to prevent or relieve severe malaria.

Objective:

- To know if a common medicine called activated charcoal can reduce severe malaria symptoms.

Eligibility:

- Children 2 to 11 years old with mild malaria who live in Kenieroba, Mali.

Design:

* For the first 2 days and nights, participants will stay in the hospital.
* They will have their medical history taken, and a physical exam.
* Blood will be drawn from a thin tube inserted in their hand or forearm. This will be done 3 times overall. A drop of blood will be taken from a finger prick 12 times overall.
* An antimalarial drug will be injected into the tube in the arm 4 times. Each time the drug is given, participants will drink a small cup of either water or activated charcoal.
* For the following 3 days, participants will take an antimalarial pill.
* On day 7, participants will visit the hospital.
