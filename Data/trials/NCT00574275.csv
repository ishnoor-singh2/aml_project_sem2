NCT00574275,Aflibercept Compared to Placebo in Term of Efficacy in Patients Treated With Gemcitabine for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00574275,VANILLA,TERMINATED,"The main objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of aflibercept treatment by comparison to placebo in increasing the overall survival (OS) in participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer, treated with gemcitabine.

The secondary objectives were to evaluate progression free survival, clinical benefit, overall response, safety and immunogenicity of aflibercept, in the two treatment arms (Arm 1: Aflibercept and Gemcitabine; Arm 2: Placebo and Gemcitabine).

The study included an interim analysis of OS. In accordance with the study protocol, an interim analysis was performed for the purpose of futility and overwhelming efficacy. On the basis of the interim analysis, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that this study be terminated for futility based on predefined boundary rules.",YES,Pancreatic Neoplasm,"DRUG: Aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept, AVE0005, VEGF trap, ZALTRAP®)|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Gemcitabine","Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If death was not observed during the study, data on OS were censored at the earlier of the last date participant was known to be alive, or the study data cutoff date (11 September 2009).

OS time was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots., From the first randomization until the end of study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years)","Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Criteria, PFS was the time interval from the date of registration to the date of progression, or death from any cause if it occurs before tumor progression is documented. Tumor progression was assessed using RECIST criteria, by which progression was a pre-defined increase in the size of existing tumors or appearance of one or more new tumors.

If a participant did not progress or die, the progression was censored to the date of the last valid tumor assessment or data cut-off, whichever was earlier.

Median PFS time was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots., From the first randomization until the end of study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Assessed by the Investigators According to RECIST Criteria, Objective response (OR) included complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\]. OR was to be assessed by the Investigators according to RECIST criteria, and confirmed by repeating tumor imaging at least 4 weeks after the first radiological documentation of response.

CR would reflect the disappearance of all tumor lesions and PR would reflect a defined reduction of tumor burden.

However, OR analysis was not performed, as the study was terminated due to futility., From the first randomization until the end of the study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years)|Clinical Benefit, Clinical benefit was to be assessed in all participants by time to symptom worsening (TTSW), evaluated from the time of randomization to symptom worsening, as well as by improvement in tumor related symptoms.

However, this analysis was not performed, as the study was terminated due to futility., From the first randomization until the end of the study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years)|Safety-Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment, spanning from the signature of informed consent until 30 days after the last administration of study treatment, were recorded. The number of participants with all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), serious adverse events (SAE), TEAE leading to death, and TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation are reported., up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation. SAEs and related AEs were followed till resolved or stabilized.|Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies, Anti-drug antibodies in the participants blood sample were detected using a validated immunoassay. The validated lower limit of detection (LLOD) for the assay was about 5.4 ng/mL in the absence of aflibercept and about 25.2 ng/mL in the presence of 20 μg/mL of aflibercept., Up to 90 days post last dose of study drug",,Sanofi,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,546,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",EFC10547|EudraCT 2007-003476-19,2007-12,2009-10,2010-11,2007-12-17,2012-08-17,2016-06-07,"Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Bridgewater, New Jersey, 08807, United States|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Buenos Aires, Argentina|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Wien, Austria|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Diegem, Belgium|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Sofia, Bulgaria|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Laval, Canada|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Santiago, Chile|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Santafe de Bogota, Colombia|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Nikosia, Cyprus|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Praha, Czech Republic|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Paris, France|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Berlin, Germany|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Athens, Greece|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Budapest, Hungary|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Mumbai, India|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Milano, Italy|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Mexico, Mexico|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Warszawa, Poland|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Bucuresti, Romania|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Moscow, Russian Federation|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Brastislava, Slovakia|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Barcelona, Spain|Sanofi-Aventis Administrative Office, Geneva, Switzerland",
