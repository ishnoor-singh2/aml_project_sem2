NCT01227928,"Efficacy and Safety of Pazopanib Monotherapy After First-line Chemotherapy in Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer in Asian Women",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01227928,,COMPLETED,"This is a study to determine whether therapy with pazopanib is effective and safe in Asian women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer whose cancer has not progressed on first-line chemotherapy.",YES,"Neoplasms, Ovarian",DRUG: Pazopanib|DRUG: Placebo comparator,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time interval between randomization and evidence of progressive disease (PD), as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, or death, whichever occurred first. A visit-based analysis approach to determine participants' dates of progression was applied in the analysis method. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants who were alive and had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the date associated with the last visit with adequate assessment., From randomization until evidence of progressive disease or death, whichever occurred first (average of 15.2 months)","Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From randomization until death due to any cause (average of 29.4 months)|PFS by Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Criteria, PFS by GCIG criteria is defined as the time from the randomization date to the earliest date of disease progression (PD) per GCIG criteria or death due to any cause. Per GCIG criteria, an objective progression is defined as the earliest event of either tumor progression based on RECIST v1.0 or confirmed CA-125 progression. A participant is counted as ""Progressed per RECIST"" if the radiological PD per RECIST occurred prior to or on the same day as CA-125 progression. A participant is counted as ""Progressed per CA-125"" if the radiological PD occurred after CA-125 progression. Per RECIST, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants who were alive and had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the date associated with the last visit with adequate assessment., From randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per GCIG criteria or death due to any cause (average of 15.2 months)|Number of Participants With Any Dose Reduction or Any Dose Interruption, Dose interruptions or reductions may have been required following potential drug-related toxicities. As a general rule, if dose reduction of investigational product (IP) was necessary, the dose should have been reduced stepwise by 200 mg at each step, and the participant should have been monitored for 10 to 14 days. If toxicity recurred or worsened during this monitoring time, the IP could have been interrupted and/or the dose of IP further decreased, with continued monitoring for an additional 10 to 14 days, and so on. The cut off for these data was October 12, 2012., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With Any Non-serious Adverse Event (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalizaton or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. See the non-serious AE/SAE module for a list of specific events., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With Any On-therapy AE and Any AE Related to Study Treatment, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. On-therapy AEs were those reported from the first day that randomized study drug was received to 28 days after the last dose of randomized study drug, and within 28 days of dose interruption. Relatedness was assessed by the Investigator., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With Any Grade 3 or 4 AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 3.0 was used to grade AEs per the following scale to assess severity: Grade 1, mild; Grade 2, moderate; Grade 3, severe; Grade 4, life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5, death related to AE., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With the Indicated On-therapy Grade 3-5 AEs, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. On-therapy AEs were those reported from the first day that randomized study drug was received to 28 days after the last dose of randomized study drug, and within 28 days of dose interruption. The NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0 was used to grade AEs per the following scale to assess severity: Grade 1, mild; Grade 2, moderate; Grade 3, severe; Grade 4, life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5, death related to AE. ALT=alanine aminotransferase; AST=aspartate aminotransferase., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With AEs Leading to Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment, Dose Interruption, and Dose Reduction, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Dose interruptions or reductions may have been required following potential drug-related toxicities. As a general rule, if dose reduction of investigational product (IP) was necessary, the dose should have been reduced stepwise by 200 mg at each step, and the participant should have been monitored for 10 to 14 days. If toxicity recurred or worsened during this monitoring time, the IP could have been interrupted and/or the dose of IP further decreased, with continued monitoring for an additional 10 to 14 days, and so on., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With Any SAE, Any SAE Related to Study Treatment, and Any Fatal SAE, An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalizaton or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. See the non-serious AE/SAE module for a list of specific events. Relatedness was assessed by the Investigator., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Blood Pressure Shifts From Baseline, Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Diatolic blood pressure (DBP) are measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A participant could have been counted in more than one shift category. Participants who experienced shifts in both SBP and DBP are represented under each individual parameter. A worst-case on-therapy shift is defined as the worst shift that occurred at any time during the treatment period., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Shift From Baseline in Bazett's Corrected QT Interval (QTc), 12-lead ECGs were obtained at the scheduled visits. A worst-case on-therapy shift is defined as the worst shift that occurred at any time during the treatment period. The QTc is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. In general, the faster the heart rate the shorter the QTc. If a QTc \>=500 milliseconds (msec) was noted on a scheduled or unscheduled electrocardiogram (ECG), then two additional ECGs should have been obtained within 5 minutes to confirm the abnormality. The average QTc was determined from the three ECG tracings by manual evaluation and was used to determine continued eligibility., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Hematology Parameter Grade Shifts From Baseline Grade, Grade shifts from Baseline were assessed as any grade increase (AGI), increase to Grade (G) 3 (ITG3), and increase to Grade 4 (ITG4). Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events), version 4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. The CTCAE displays Grades (G) 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on the following general guideline: G1, mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated; G2, moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL); G3, severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL; G4, Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.; G5, death related to AE., From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Chemistry Parameter Grade Shifts From Baseline Grade, Grade shifts from Baseline were assessed as any grade increase (AGI), increase to Grade (G) 3 (ITG3), and increase to Grade 4 (ITG4).
