NCT00565448,Docetaxel in Combination With Cisplatin-5-fluorouracil for the Induction Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Children and Adolescents,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00565448,,COMPLETED,"The primary objective is to estimate the Complete Response rate of docetaxel to the combination of cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (TCF) compared to cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (CF) in the Induction treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC).

The secondary objectives are to determine:

* the safety of TCF in comparison to CF after induction treatment of NPC,
* the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel when added to CF,
* the Overall Response rate of TCF and CF on completion of induction and consolidation (chemo-radiotherapy) treatment of NPC, and to compare overall survival between TCF and CF.",YES,Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms|Carcinoma,DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil,"Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR), CR assessed by independent reviewers, according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Disease response evaluated after the completion of the induction treatment and prior to the radiation treatment. CR defined as the complete disappearance of the target and non-target lesion(s) identified at baseline after radiological evaluation by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) only., after the completion of the induction treatment (up to 9 weeks)","Docetaxel Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) in the Docetaxel/Cisplatin/5-FU Group, AUC estimated by Bayesian method using concentration-time data for each participant and the previously defined adult population model as prior information (with validity of the estimation verified)., Three plasma samples: one just before then 45 minutes and 5hour after the end of cycle 1 infusion|Overall Response (OR), OR is classified as CR, partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or Unknown on completion of both induction and radiation treatment and assessed according to the Modified RECIST from the NCI. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs. PR is defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of TLs, taking as reference the disease measurement done at study entry. PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest disease measurement recorded at study entry or the appearance of ≥1 new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-TLs. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., after the completion of the consolidation treatment (up to 18 weeks)|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS rate is the percentage of participants who survived 3 years after completion of consolidation treatment period. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS rate., 3 years after the end of the consolidation treatment period (up to 40 months from randomization)",,Sanofi,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE2,75,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EFC10339|2007-001211-33,2007-11,2009-03,2012-01,2007-11-30,2010-03-05,2015-07-30,"Investigational Site Number 012001, Alger, 16005, Algeria|Investigational Site Number 076002, Rio De Janeiro, 20230-130, Brazil|Investigational Site Number 076001, Sao Paulo, 04023-062, Brazil|Investigational Site Number 156005, Fuzhou, 350014, China|Investigational Site Number 250001, Villejuif Cedex, 94805, France|Investigational Site Number 356003, Ahmedabad, 380006, India|Investigational Site Number 356004, Kolkata, 700054, India|Investigational Site Number 356002, Thiruvananthapuram, 695011, India|Investigational Site Number 356001, Vellore, 632004, India|Investigational Site Number 360001, Jakarta, 10430, Indonesia|Investigational Site Number 380001, Milano, 20133, Italy|Investigational Site Number 410001, Seoul, 110-744, Korea, Republic of|Investigational Site Number 410003, Seoul, 135-710, Korea, Republic of|Investigational Site Number 410002, Seoul, 138-736, Korea, Republic of|Investigational Site Number 484001, Villahermosa, 86100, Mexico|Investigational Site Number 504001, Casablanca, 20000, Morocco|Investigational Site Number 504002, Rabat, 10000, Morocco|Investigational Site Number 504003, Rabat, Morocco|Investigational Site Number 608002, Quezon City, Philippines|Investigational Site Number 764001, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand|Investigational Site Number 764002, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand|Investigational Site Number 788002, Sousse, 4000, Tunisia|Investigational Site Number 788003, Tunis, 1006, Tunisia|Investigational Site Number 792003, Abacioglu, 34662, Turkey|Investigational Site Number 792001, Ankara, 06100, Turkey|Investigational Site Number 792002, Istanbul, 34303, Turkey",
