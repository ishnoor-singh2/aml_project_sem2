NCT05817110,Validating Artificial Intelligence Effectiveness Defined Lung Nodule Malignancy Score in Patients With Pulmonary Nodule.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05817110,CREATE,RECRUITING,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithms have demonstrated increased accuracy in predicting the risk of Lung Cancer among patients with an incidental pulmonary nodule (IPN) on chest radiographs. Qure.ai, an AI company specializing in the reading of chest X- Rays (CXRs) by a proprietary algorithm and has developed a new model, qXR, that can report the lung nodule malignancy score (LNMS) based on lung nodule features.

Our study aims to prospectively validate the lung nodule malignancy score against radiologist assessment of CT scans and Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System score (Lung-RADS).(lung RADS score explained below) Thus, lung nodule malignancy score (interpreted by qXR as a high or low category) will be compared with radiologist-based assessment probability of CT scan and Lung-RADS assessment. The results of this prospective observational study will pave the way for improved nodule management, leading to better clinical outcomes in patients with incidental pulmonary nodule (IPNs), especially concerning malignancy assessment.",NO,Lung Malignancy,OTHER: Participant Cohort,"To estimate the positive and negative predictive values of qXR LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score ) in a multi-centre real-world setting., PPV( positive predictive value) of qXR-LNMS using a panel of radiologists assigning high-risk based on CT (done within 180 days from Xray) as the reference standard The PPV here is the number of nodules rated as high risk as assessed by a reference standard (a panel of radiologists) on CT divided by the total number of high-risk nodules as reported by qXR-LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score ) (n = 500) NPV( negative predictive value) of qXR-LNMS using panel of radiologists assigning low-risk based on CT (done within 180days from X-ray) as reference standard.

The NPV here is number of nodules rated as low risk as assessed by a reference standard (a panel of radiologists) on CT divided by total number of low-risk nodules as reported by qXR-LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score ) (n = 200), 6 months from the Last subject In.","Demographic and clinical factors associated with high or low predictive values association of qXR LNMS with the Mayo score model., PPV (positive predictive value) of qXR-LNMS (lung nodule malignancy score) using panel of radiologists assigning Lung-RADS (lung RADS score explained in description )\>4A based on CT as reference standard.
