NCT01726673,Robots Paired With tDCS in Stroke Recovery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01726673,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate if multiple therapy sessions of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS non-invasive brain stimulation) combined with robotic arm therapy lead to a greater functional recovery in upper limb mobility after stroke than that provided by robotic arm therapy alone.,YES,Stroke,DEVICE: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)|DEVICE: Placebo sham,"Median Change in Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Assessment Score, The median change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score was calculated from baseline to discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and again at 36 weeks (6 months follow-up from the intervention) in each training condition (sham tDCS + robotics arm training vs. active tDCS + robotic arm training). The total Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer score is reported, with a range 0-66 points, and with higher values indicating better functional status., baseline, discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention), and follow-up at 36 weeks (6 months after the intervention)","Median Change in WOLF Motor Function Test (WMFT), The median change in performance time for the WOLF motor function test was calculated from baseline to discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and again at 36 weeks (6 months follow-up from the intervention) in each training condition (sham tDCS + robotics arm training vs. active tDCS + robotic arm training). The total WOLF motor function timed score is reported here in seconds, with a range 0-1800 seconds, and with lower values indicating faster completion of task and better functional status., baseline, discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention), and follow-up at 36 weeks (6 months after the intervention)|Median Change in Motor Power Manual Muscle Test Score for the Upper Extremity (MRC), The median change in Motor Power Manual Muscle Test Score for the upper extremity was calculated from baseline to discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and again at 36 weeks (6 months follow-up from the intervention) in each training condition (sham tDCS + robotics arm training vs. active tDCS + robotic arm training).

NCT01507688,Stroke Self-Management: Effect on Function and Stroke Specific Quality of Life,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01507688,,COMPLETED,"The experience of a stroke event may result in a disruption to the survivor's daily life. Patients with stroke have reported fears of permanent disability and major concerns over their ability to recover and be productive and engaged with family, friends and coworkers. To enhance recovery from stroke, the investigators designed a stroke self-management program and have pilot tested the program among Veterans recovering from stroke/TIA. The study is a three-site, randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of a stroke self-management program. The intervention program includes 6 bi-weekly sessions over months 1-3 followed by monthly telephone calls as the investigators administered in the investigators' pilot study during months 4-6 for a total length of program duration of 6 months. The investigators have added 3 monthly group support sessions during months 4-6 for additional peer support. Thus, participants will receive bi-monthly support during months 4-6. The three intervention sites include the Jesse Brown VAMC in Chicago, the Roudebush VAMC in Indianapolis, and the IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. The three hospitals represent facilities with a small, moderate, and large volume of acute stroke care, respectively. Additionally, Methodist Hospital includes a greater proportion of women which enables us to study the patterns and preferences of women with stroke/TIA and tailor the investigators' future programs to prepare for the increasing female Veteran population.",YES,Stroke,BEHAVIORAL: Stroke Self-Management,"Total Stroke Specific Quality of Life, A 49-item instrument that assesses 12 domains relevant to stroke patients' health-related quality of life including: energy, mobility, work, upper extremity function, activities of daily living, family roles, social roles, vision, language, thinking, mood, and personality. A lower score indicates poorer functioning and a higher score indicates better functioning. The minimum value was 1 and maximum value was 5. A Total Stroke Specific Quality of Life Score was calculated as the mean of the 49-items., Change from baseline to 6 months",,,VA Office of Research and Development,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,258,FED,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,SDP 10-379,2013-01-07,2017-03-31,2019-08-29,2012-01-11,2018-03-07,2023-07-27,"Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL, Chicago, Illinois, 60612, United States|Richard L.
