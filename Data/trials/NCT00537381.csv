NCT00537381,An Efficacy and Safety Study of Intetumumab (CNTO 95) in Participants With Metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00537381,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of intetumumab when given in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to participants with metastatic (spread of cancer cells from one part of the body to another) hormone-refractory (not responding to treatment) prostate cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body until it kills).,YES,Prostatic Neoplasms,DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Prednisone|BIOLOGICAL: Intetumumab|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The PFS was assessed as median number of days from baseline until the first documented sign of disease progression (increase in disease; radiographic, clinical, or both) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier., Baseline up to 6 months after last dose of study treatment, assessed up to 551 days","Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (OR), Number of participants with best OR is based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR). Confirmed CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR is defined as greater than or equal to 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study greater than or equal to 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Baseline up to 6 months after last dose of study treatment, assessed up to 551 days|Number of Participants With Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, The PSA response is defined as at least a 50 percent decrease in PSA below the baseline value, confirmed by a second PSA value greater than or equal to 6 weeks later. A participant was considered to be a PSA responder if and only if the response occurs prior to PSA progression (increase of at least 25 percent and an increase of 5 nanogram per milliliter from the lowest observed PSA value since initiation of treatment, to be confirmed greater than or equal to 3 weeks later)., Baseline up to 6 months after last dose of study treatment or early withdrawal, assessed up to 601 days|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to death due to any cause. For participants who were alive at the time of analysis, overall survival was censored at the last contact date., Baseline until death (up to 887 days)|Percent Change From Baseline in 'C-telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTx)' Marker Concentration, Percent change = marker concentration at time of measurement minus baseline value divided by baseline value multiplied by 100., Baseline, Week 6, 7, 10 and 13|Percent Change From Baseline in 'N-telopeptide of Type I Collagen (NTx)' Marker Concentration, Percent change = marker concentration at time of measurement minus baseline value divided by baseline value multiplied by 100., Baseline, Week 6, 7, 10 and 13|Percent Change From Baseline in 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)' Marker Concentration, Percent change = marker concentration at time of measurement minus baseline value divided by baseline value multiplied by 100., Baseline, Week 6, 7, 10 and 13",,"Centocor, Inc.",,MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,131,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CR013249|C1034T08|2006-005766-39,2007-05,2009-11,2009-11,2007-10-01,2013-03-28,2013-06-20,"Birmingham, Alabama, United States|Los Angeles, California, United States|San Bernardino, California, United States|Wichita, Kansas, United States|Shreveport, Louisiana, United States|Charleston, South Carolina, United States|N Charleston, South Carolina, United States|Graz, Austria|Wels N/A, Austria|Wien, Austria|Antwerpen, Belgium|Brasschaat, Belgium|Brussel, Belgium|Doornik, Belgium|Haine-Saint-Paul, La Louviere, Belgium|Leuven, Belgium|Liÿge, Belgium|Ottignies, Belgium|Roeselare, Belgium|Wilrijk, Belgium|Aschaffenburg, Germany|Berlin, Germany|Freiburg, Germany|Kirchheim, Germany|Köln, Germany|Marburg, Germany|München, Germany|Tübingen, Germany|Ahmedabad, India|Bangalore, India|Chennai, India|Mumbai, India|New Delhi, India|Pune, India|Apeldoorn, Netherlands|Den Haag, Netherlands|Leiden, Netherlands|Maastricht, Netherlands|Nijmegen, Netherlands|Bydgoszcz, Poland|Gdansk, Poland|Inowroclaw, Poland|Koscierzyna, Poland|Lodz, Poland|Lublin, Poland|Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation|Moscow N/A, Russian Federation|Moscow Region, Russian Federation|Moscow, Russian Federation|St Petersburg, Russian Federation|St-Petersburg Leningrad, Russian Federation|Voronezh, Russian Federation|Yaroslavl, Russian Federation|Johannesburg Gauteng, South Africa|Pretoria Gauteng, South Africa|Pretoria, South Africa|Cambridge, United Kingdom|Leicester, United Kingdom|Lincoln, United Kingdom|London, United Kingdom",
