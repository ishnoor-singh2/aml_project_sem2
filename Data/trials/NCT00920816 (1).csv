PFS calculated as (first event date minus date of randomization plus 1)/30.4. Tumor progression determined from oncologic assessment data (where it meets criteria for progressive disease \[PD\]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where outcome was ""Death""). Progression using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is \>= 20 percent (%) increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; measurable increase in non-target lesion; appearance of new lesions., Baseline until disease progression or death (assessed on Week 6, Week 12 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 107)|Progression Free Survival (PFS): Second-Line Participants, Time in months from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause.

OS was calculated as (the death date minus the date of randomization plus 1) divided by 30.4. Death was determined from adverse event data (where outcome was death) or from follow-up contact data (where the participant current status was death)., Baseline until death (assessed on Week 6, Week 12 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 107)|Overall Survival (OS): Second-Line Participants, Time in months from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause.
