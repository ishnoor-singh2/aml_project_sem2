NCT01151215,Study of Anastrozole +/- AZD8931 in Postmenopausal Women With Endocrine Therapy Naive Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01151215,MINT,TERMINATED,The main purpose of this study is to compare progression free survival in patients treated with AZD8931 given in combination with anastrozole versus anastrozole alone. The secondary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD8931 given in combination with anastrozole.,YES,Neoplasms|Breast Neoplasms|Breast Cancer,DRUG: AZD8931|DRUG: anastrozole|DRUG: Placebo,"Progression Free Survival as Evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, Time from the date of randomization until the date of objective disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or the date of death (by any cause in the absence of progression). Disease progression is defined using RECIST 1.1 as \>=20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of \>=5mm, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameters of target lesions since study start, or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions, or appearance of any new lesions., Tumour assessment by RECIST 1.1 every 12 weeks until data cut-off at 31 August 2012","Compare the Overall Survival in Patients Treated With AZD8931 in Combination With Anastrozole Versus Anastrozole Alone, Time from the date of randomization to the date of death (by any cause), Following progression, patients were contacted at 12 weekly intervals until data cut-off at 31 August 2012 to determine survival status",,AstraZeneca,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,482,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",D0102C00004,2010-06,2013-01,2013-01,2010-06-28,2014-01-29,2014-07-25,"Research Site, Lake Success, New York, United States|Research Site, Belo Horizonte, Brazil|Research Site, Goiânia, Brazil|Research Site, Ijuí, Brazil|Research Site, Porto Alegre, Brazil|Research Site, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Research Site, Sao Paulo, Brazil|Research Site, São Paulo, Brazil|Research Site, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada|Research Site, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada|Research Site, Montreal, Quebec, Canada|Research Site, Brno, Czech Republic|Research Site, Olomouc, Czech Republic|Research Site, Praha 2, Czech Republic|Research Site, Praha 4, Czech Republic|Research Site, Helsinki, Finland|Research Site, Tampere, Finland|Research Site, Turku, Finland|Research Site, Bangalore, India|Research Site, Hyderabad, India|Research Site, Mumbai, India|Research Site, Pune, India|Research Site, Trivandrum, India|Research Site, Vellore, India|Research Site, Niigata-shi, Japan|Research Site, Osaka-shi, Japan|Research Site, Ota-shi, Japan|Research Site, Sapporo-shi, Japan|Research Site, Seoul, Korea, Republic of|Research Site, Durango, Mexico|Research Site, Juchitan, Mexico|Research Site, Merida, Mexico|Research Site, Monterrey, Mexico|Research Site, Callao, Peru|Research Site, Lima, Peru|Research Site, Piura, Peru|Research Site, Iloilo City, Philippines|Research Site, Lipa City, Philippines|Research Site, Pasay City, Philippines|Research Site, Quezon City, Philippines|Research Site, Białystok, Poland|Research Site, Elbląg, Poland|Research Site, Kraków, Poland|Research Site, Warszawa, Poland|Research Site, Kuzmolovsky, Russian Federation|Research Site, Moscow, Russian Federation|Research Site, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation|Research Site, Durban, South Africa|Research Site, Pretoria, South Africa|Research Site, Taipei, Taiwan|Research Site, Bangkok, Thailand|Research Site, Songkla, Thailand|Research Site, Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine|Research Site, Lviv, Ukraine|Research Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom|Research Site, Bournemouth, United Kingdom|Research Site, Coventry, United Kingdom|Research Site, Leicester, United Kingdom|Research Site, London, United Kingdom|Research Site, Nottingham, United Kingdom|Research Site, Surrey, United Kingdom|Research Site, Wythenshawe, Manchester, United Kingdom",
