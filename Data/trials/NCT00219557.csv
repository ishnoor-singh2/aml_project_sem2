NCT00219557,AG-013736 In Combination With Gemcitabine Versus Gemcitabine Alone For Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00219557,,COMPLETED,"This is a Phase 2 study being conducted at multiple centers in the United States, Europe and Canada. Patients having pancreatic cancer that is locally advanced or that has spread to other parts of the body (i.e., metastatic) are eligible to participate. Patients must have not had any prior systemic treatment for advanced disease. The purpose of the study is to test whether the angiogenesis inhibitor Axitinib \[AG-013736\] in combination with gemcitabine is an effective treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer vs. gemcitabine alone by overall survival.",YES,Pancreatic Neoplasms,DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: AG-013736|DRUG: Gemcitabine,"Overall Survival (OS), Time in days from randomization to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as the death date minus the date of randomization plus 1.

ClinicalTrials.gov is designed for reporting results from only those participants who were enrolled in the study and described in the Participant Flow and Baseline Characteristics modules., Phase 2 Day 1 (Pre-dose), Day 29, Day 57 and then every 8 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation from study or up to 80 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Overall Response (OR), Percentage of participants with OR based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR are defined as the disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non-target). PR are those with at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum of longest dimensions., Phase 2 baseline to disease progression or discontinuation from study, assessed every 8 weeks up to 80 weeks|Duration of Response (DR), Time in days from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cancer. Duration of tumor response was calculated as the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response., Phase 2 baseline to disease progression or discontinuation from study due to any cause, assessed every 8 weeks up to 80 weeks|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time in days from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause.

Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.

Questions include on altered bowel habits, pain, dietary changes, disease and Tx-related symptoms and issues related to the emotional and social well-being of participants with PC. All 26 Qs are answered on 4-point Likert scale ranging from '1=not at all' to 4='very much' and subsequently transformed into scales that range from 0-100. Higher scores on functioning scales=better functioning; higher scores on the symptom scales=more symptoms., Phase 2 baseline [Day (D) 1 of Cycle (C)1], Day 1 of all subsequent cycles up to Cycle 14 and end of study (EoS).",,Pfizer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,111,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,A4061016|2005-000053-30,2005-07-05,2008-03-14,2008-03-14,2005-09-22,2012-02-25,2019-05-14,"East Bay Medical Oncology/Hematology Medical Associates Inc., Antioch, California, 94509, United States|Alta Bates Comprehensive Cancer Center, Berkeley, California, 94704, United States|Bay Area Cancer Research Group, Concord, California, 94520, United States|East Bay Medical Oncology/Hematology Medical Associates, Inc., Concord, California, 94520, United States|Hematology Oncology, P.C., Stamford, Connecticut, 06902-3628, United States|Jackson Memorial Hospital & Clinics, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|University of Miami Hospital & clinics, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa, Florida, 33612-9497, United States|Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Blood Disorders, Biddeford, Maine, 04005, United States|Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Blood Disorders, Brunswick, Maine, 04011, United States|Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Blood Disorders, Scarborough, Maine, 04074, United States|Arch Medical Services, Inc. d/b/a The Center for Cancer Care and Research, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63141, United States|Arch Medical Services, Inc. d/b/a The Center for Cancer Care and Research, Washington, Missouri, 63090, United States|Southeast Nebraska Cancer Center, Southeast Nebraska Hematology and Oncology Consultants, P.C., Lincoln, Nebraska, 68510, United States|Piedmont Hematology Oncology Association, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27103, United States|Piedmont Hematology Oncology Associates, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27292, United States|University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, Wisconsin, 53792, United States|Universitair Ziekenhuis Gent/Dienst Gastroenterologie, Gent, 9000, Belgium|Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada|Cancer Care Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R2H 2A6, Canada|CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada|Sault Area Hospital, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, P6A 2C4, Canada|Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada|CHUM, Hopital Saint-Luc, Montreal, Quebec, H2X 3J4, Canada|Service Oncologie Medicale, Saint-Herblain, Saint Herblain Cedex, 44805, France|Hopital La Timone, Marseille, 13005, France|Hopital de la Pitie Salpetriere, Paris Cedex 13, 75651, France|Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, 31052, France|Medizinische Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Haematologie und Onkologie, Charité-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, 13353, Germany|Fondazione IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Oncologia Medica B, Milano, 20133, Italy|Unita Operativa, Oncologia Medica, Istituto di Medicina Interna e Geriatria, Roma, 00168, Italy|Hospital Universitario Vall D´Hebron, Barcelona, 08035, Spain|Hospital Clinic I Provincial de Barcelona, Barcelona, 08036, Spain|Hospital Universitario Virgen Del Rocio, Sevilla, 41013, Spain|Cancer Research Uk Clinical Centre, Southampton, Hampshire, SO16 6YD, United Kingdom|Department of Cancer Studies & Molecular Medicine, Leicester, Leicestershire, LE1 5WW, United Kingdom|Western General Hospitals Nhs Trust, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, United Kingdom|Hammersmith Hospital, London, W12 OHS, United Kingdom",
