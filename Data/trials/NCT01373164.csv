NCT01373164,A Study in Metastatic Cancer and Advanced or Metastatic Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01373164,,COMPLETED,"Phase 1b: To determine the safe and tolerable dose of galunisertib in combination with gemcitabine in patients with solid malignancy

Phase 2a: To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with Stage II to IV unresectable pancreatic cancer when treated with a combination of galunisertib and gemcitabine with that of gemcitabine plus placebo.",YES,Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis|Pancreatic Cancer,DRUG: Galunisertib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Placebo,"Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 Dose, The recommended Phase 2 dose was the highest dose where less than 1/3 of participants experienced dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The recommended dose was determined based on a review of overall toxicity, dose reductions, omissions, and pharmacokinetic information from Phase 1b., Time of first phase 1b dose until time of last phase 1b dose (up to 1 year)|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, overall survival duration was censored for that analysis at the date of last prior contact., Baseline to date of death from any cause (up to 2 years)","Phase 1b: Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve at Steady State From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC[0-24], ss) and Time Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-∞], ss), AUC\[0-24h\] is a combined measure obtained from Day 14 at 0 hour (pre-dose), 0.5, 2,3, 6 hours post dose and morning doses from 24h and 48h to compute. AUC0-infinity will take 48h and extrapolation beyond this in addition to earlier time points to be calculated. All mentioned time points are used to calculate the two AUCs., Cycle 1 Days 14 (predose; 0.5, 2, 3, and 6 hours post dose), 24h (Days 15) and 48h (Days 16)|Phase 1b: Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Plasma Drug Concentration at Steady State (Cmax,ss), Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis were obtained on Day 14 at 0 hours (Pre-dose), 0.5, 2, 3, 6 hours post dose and morning doses from 24h and 48h. Cmax takes all time points post dose into account and one value is reported., Cycle 1 Days 14 (predose; 0.5, 2, 3, and 6 hours post dose), 24h (Days 15) and 48h (Days 16)|Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Tumor Response, Response was defined using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) version 1.1. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir; Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria., Baseline to end of Phase 1b (up to 1 year)|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the date of randomization to the first date of progression of disease or of death from any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died or to have had a progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, PFS will be censored at the date of last prior contact. PFS will be calculated and analyzed twice: (1) including clinical progressions of disease not based on lesion measurements, and (2) excluding clinical progressions. Progression Disease (PD) was defined as having at least a 25% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Baseline to first date of progressive disease or death due to any cause (up to 2 years)|Phase 2: Percentage Change From Baseline in Tumor Size (CTS), Change in tumor size is defined as the maximum percent change from baseline in the sum of target lesions. Change was assessed in each participant using radiographic imaging., Baseline, end of Cycle 2 (up to 56 days)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate[ORR]), Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100., Baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 2 years)|Phase 2: Population Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC[0-24]), AUC\[0-24\] is a combined measure obtained from Day 14 at 0 hour (pre-dose), 0.5, 2,3, 6 hours post dose and morning doses from 24h and 48h to compute., Cycle 1 Days 14 (predose; 0.5, 2, 3, and 6 hours post dose), 24h (Days 15) and 48h (Days 16)|Phase 2: Population PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Galunisertib, Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis were obtained on Day 14 at 0 hours (Pre-dose), 0.5, 2, 3, 6 hours post dose and morning doses from 24h and 48h. Cmax takes all time points post dose into account and one value is reported., Cycle 1 Days 14 (predose; 0.5, 2, 3, and 6 hours post dose), 24h (Days 15) and 48h (Days 16)|Phase 2: Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory-short Form (BPI-sf) at Study Completion, The BPI-SF Pain Severity Subscale was a participant-rated questionnaire that measured the severity of pain. Severity scores could have ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) for questions that included assessing average pain in the past 24 hours., Baseline, study treatment completion (up to 1 year)|Phase 2: Change From Baseline in Carbohydrate Antigen 19.9 (CA19-9) Level at First Study Completion Follow-up, Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a modified Lewis(a) blood group antigen, and has been used as a tumor marker. The outcome measure is the median, minimum and maximum values from participants who had samples collected at baseline and at follow-up, Baseline, study treatment completion after first follow up visit (up to 1 year)",,Eli Lilly and Company,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,170,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,13663|H9H-MC-JBAJ,2011-06,2015-11,2016-12,2011-06-14,2018-02-23,2018-05-16,"Florida Hospital Tampa HPG and Foregut Surgery, Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|Ingalls Memorial Hospital, Harvey, Illinois, 60426, United States|Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|For additional information regarding investigative sites for this trial, contact 1-877-CTLILLY (1-877-285-4559, 1-317-615-4559) Mon -
